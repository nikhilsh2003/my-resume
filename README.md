Hey there! Check out my Interactive Resume!
So, this isn't just your average resume – it's a super cool, single-page website that lets you really explore what I'm all about! Think of it as my digital portfolio, showing off my experience, skills, projects, and all the cool stuff I've done.

What's Under the Hood?
We kept it simple and sweet, all in one HTML file, so it's easy to get up and running:

HTML5: That's the backbone, holding everything together.

Tailwind CSS: This is like my secret weapon for making things look awesome and work perfectly on any screen, from your phone to a big monitor.

Chart.js: Yep, I've got some neat charts in here to show off my skills and competitive programming scores. They're interactive, too!

Vanilla JavaScript: This is the magic behind all the buttons, filters, and dynamic bits that make the whole thing feel alive.

What Can You Do Here?
I've designed this little app to be super easy and fun to use:

Sticky Navigation: See that menu at the top? It sticks with you as you scroll, so you can jump to any section (Experience, Skills, Projects, Achievements) in a flash!

My Career Journey: My work experience is laid out like a cool timeline. It's way more interesting than just a list, right?

Skills Spotlight:

There's a Radar Chart that gives you a quick visual on my main tech strengths. Pretty neat!

And you can filter through my skills too! Just click a button to see only the languages, or backend stuff, or DevOps tools – whatever you're curious about.

Coding Challenge Scores: Want to see how I stack up in competitive programming? There's a bar chart that shows my ratings from different platforms.

Project Showcase: My personal projects are laid out in nice, clean cards. Easy to skim and see what I've built!

Looks Good on Any Device!
I made sure this resume looks great whether you're on a desktop, a tablet, or your phone. No weird scrolling or tiny text here!

Smart Layouts: Thanks to Tailwind CSS, everything adjusts itself nicely.

Mobile-Friendly Menu: On smaller screens, you'll see a little menu icon – tap it to get around!

Charts That Adapt: Those charts? They resize themselves to fit your screen perfectly.

Smooth Sailing: The whole site flows smoothly, no awkward side-to-side scrolling, ever!
