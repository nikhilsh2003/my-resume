# Interactive Software Engineer Resume

This is a single-page interactive web application serving as a dynamic and visually engaging resume for Nikhil Sharma. It transforms a traditional resume into an explorable portfolio, highlighting professional experience, technical skills, projects, and achievements through interactive elements and data visualizations.

## Technologies Used

This interactive resume is built using a modern frontend stack, primarily within a single HTML file for simplicity and easy deployment:

* **HTML5:** Provides the core structure and content of the web page.

* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid UI development, ensuring a clean, professional, and fully responsive design across all devices.

* **Chart.js:** A powerful JavaScript charting library utilized for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations, such as the skills radar chart and competitive programming ratings bar chart.

* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Powers all the interactive elements, dynamic content updates, navigation functionality, and data filtering logic within the application.

## Interactive Features

The application is designed to offer an engaging and intuitive user experience:

* **Sticky Navigation:** A fixed header navigation allows for quick and easy access to different sections of the resume (Experience, Skills, Projects, Achievements) as the user scrolls.

* **Interactive Experience Timeline:** Professional experience is presented in a visually appealing timeline format, making career progression easy to follow.

* **Dynamic Skills Dashboard:**

  * A **Radar Chart** provides a high-level visual summary of proficiency across key technical areas.

  * **Filterable Skill Categories** allow users to dynamically display specific sets of skills (e.g., Languages, Backend, DevOps), making it easy to focus on relevant technologies.

* **Competitive Programming Ratings Chart:** A bar chart visually compares ratings across different competitive programming platforms (LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef), offering a clear understanding of performance.

* **Project Showcase:** Projects are presented in clean, card-like layouts, providing concise overviews.

## Responsive Design

The resume is built with a mobile-first approach to ensure optimal viewing and interaction on any device:

* **Tailwind CSS Grid and Flexbox:** Used extensively to create flexible and adaptive layouts that rearrange and resize gracefully on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

* **Mobile Navigation:** A dedicated hamburger menu appears on smaller screens, providing an accessible way to navigate the different sections.

* **Responsive Charts:** Chart.js configurations ensure that all charts scale appropriately within their containers, maintaining readability and preventing overflow on smaller screens.

* **Fluid Layouts:** All elements and sections are designed with relative units and responsive classes to prevent horizontal scrolling and ensure a seamless experience across diverse viewports.
